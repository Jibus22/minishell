/*
** If the char is 'n' instead of '\n':
** if I type '\n', it writes a newline. But if I type 'n', many times
** and continue after, it does nothing UNTIL I type '\n'.
** that means that the 'enter' key sends a signal to read() saying:
** "now you read all that has been wrote to the stdin!". Like when a fifo
** write end fd is closed (which says to read end that it can read the buffer).
**
** We could say that keyboard & read(fd0) are linked by a fifo buffer (pipe)
** & that enter key closes the write end fd.
** All characters typed after n aren't displayed because my gnl puts a 0 at
** the place of flag character.
**
** If I type '\n' before typing 'n', it just writes '\n', BUT, we can't
** backspace it. That means that read() has read. But since 'n' hasn't been met,
** line is still full and gnl didn't returned.
** So, when it's a '\n' character inside gnl, it sends a signal to read() to
** read, plus returning gnl has the met '\n'.
**
**
** ctrl^D sends EOT signal where read() then returns 0. So it says to read()
** not to read 0 Bytes but to read the fifo buffer then returns 0.
**
**
** We enter into check_ctrld when read returns 0, so when ctrl^D or ctrl^C is
** typed.
**
** ctrl^D after input: line exists -read() has read and gnl joined buf to line.
** ctrl^D with empty input: exit read() & so the minishell.
** ctrl^C: line inputed before doesn't exists because read() hadn't read.
** If inputed ctrl^D had been hited before, a line exists.
**
** When ctrl^D is hited, 2 behaviors:
**				- If Nothing had already been typed, exit the loop (return 0).
**				- else we want to stay into the read() loop to continue to
**				  create the line : don't return.
**
** When ctrl^C is hited, 1 behavior :
**				- Display a new prompt, line erased.
**
** If ctrl^D has been typed, signal() into check_ctrld will take advantage.
** Therefore, the ctrl^C signal handler called into this func has to set global
** variable line_eraser to 1, to say to the loop to erase the line.
**
** When ctrl^C is typed after a ctrl^D this is signal() inside check_ctrld()
** which catch it although we don't enter again in this func(). The only moment
** when we go into it is when ctrl^D is hited.
** But when ctrl^D is hited & read() continues, this signal() takes effect and
** takes advantage and will act when ctrl^C will be hited, until we go out of
** gnl which would have returned 1, then the more general signal() goes back.
